# DataAnalysis_and_VizualizationProject

## 911 Calls Capstone Project
### Overview
In this capstone project, we will analyze 911 call data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains various fields related to emergency 911 calls. Our objective is to explore and gain insights from this data to better understand the patterns and trends in emergency calls.

### Analysis Highlights
In this project, we will perform the following tasks:

Data loading and preprocessing.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of calls over time.
Visualizations to depict call volume trends, types of calls, and more.
Identify key insights and findings from the analysis.
### Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization libraries.
### Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip:
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run the project's main script.
### Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge Kaggle for providing the 911 call dataset, and the open-source community for the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

## Finance Data Project
